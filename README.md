# zig-deb

These are the scripts and helper files that I use to create my `.deb` files for [zig](https://ziglang.org/) that I host on [my apt packages server](http://packages.joekoop.com/).

I am not endorsed by the Zig Software Foundation. I just like their project, and see that they aren't publishing `.deb`s of their own.
